How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

It made it easier for me to find out where changes were made.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

You can find your mistakes easily and go back to a working version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

If it saves something you did wrong, then you will have trouble.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because git is for version control, and google docs probably doesn't care.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

To find out where something went wrong or if something was changed.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

It's easy to go back to something that worked.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Everything!
